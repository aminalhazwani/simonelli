text: In June 2013, to celebrate the tenth-year anniversary of its founding, the project space Lungomare opened the Lungomare Gasthaus as a temporary space for thought and action. The Lungomare Gasthaus integrated the kitchen, a cultural and social place of production, with a one-month program consisting of discussions, conversations and workshops, a series of spatial interventions, a film program and a series of public performances and actions in the city of Bolzano.

I've been asked to design seats and tables for the temporary restaurant!

The furniture were build then in a open workshop of 2 days, where a lot of people came to help us!
