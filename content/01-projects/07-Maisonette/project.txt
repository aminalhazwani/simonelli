text: "Maisonnette" in French means small house. The aim here has been to propose a collection of furnitures that meets the contemporary need of sharing functions in the microliving spaces. It is a 3 pieces set: a stand/miniwardrobe, a cart/table and a basket/tray. Materials: solid alder wood treated with natural varnish and iron rod structure.
