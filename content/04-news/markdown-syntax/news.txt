In this short article I will explain you how to use markdown syntax when creating a new project page, news or in the case you need to change infos in your about page.

In order to insert a title you have to type just ```#Title of a project```
and it will be automatically translated in a ```h1``` like this:
#Title of a project
</br>
If you would like to add a smaller title like a ```h2``` or a ```h1``` you just have to type ```##Smaller title for a project``` or ```###Even smaller title``` to produce this: 
##Smaller title for a project 
</br>
###Even smaller title
</br>

To highlight some text you can write in bold by putting your text between double " * " like this ```**I am a bold text**``` and it will be traslated like this **I am a bold text**.

You can also higlight text in italic and to do that you need to put your words between one " * " like this ```I am italic``` and it will be visualized like this *I am italic*.
*italic*

To insert a link you place your link text between square parentesis and your link between round parentesis as in the example ```[Link text](#)```.
You will see il like this [Link text](#).

If you want to insert a list you can use numbers or " * ".

```1. item```
```2. item```
```3. item```

1. item
2. item
3. item

or

```* item```
```* item```
```* item```

* item
* item
* item


You can also insert quotes in your text. In order to do that just put " > " before your quote

```> ##“The best way to accomplish serious design … is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.”```
```— Paula Scher```

> ##“The best way to accomplish serious design … is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.”
> — Paula Scher
