# simonesimonelli.it

Completely redesigned and redeveloped website for the product designer and university researcher Simone Simonelli.
The brief was to design a simple and fresh website to show the work of Simone. The homepage is an aggregation of client works, educational projects and news. All together, in one place, underlining the multidisciplinary approach of Simone. The website offers also a news page with all the latest updates of Simone's work and a standard/mandatory about page.

### Process
I kept track of the whole redesign process with a project timeline ([Brad Frost inspired](https://github.com/bradfrost/project-hub)). Link coming soon!
I spent six months working on the project with a constant and inspiring communication with Simone.

### Colophon
All content is managed with the awesome [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com/) by Bastian Allgeier.

I used Grunt.js as task runner for managing my local development environment. Compiling SASS and minifying Javascript was super easy. Code was written with Sublime Text 2.

And several components:

- HTML5 Boilerplate
- Normalize.css
- jQuery
- Modernizr
- Isotope.js
- History.js
- Imagesloaded.js
- Slicknav.js

### Typography
The whole website is set in [Montserrat](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat) from Google Fonts. We wanted a modern rounded face. Something Avenir inspired and we finally ended up choosing Montserrat.
